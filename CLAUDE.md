# CLAUDE.md — ELO League Tracker

This file provides Claude Code with full context on the project architecture, conventions, and decisions made during planning. Read this before making any changes.

---

## What this project is

A SaaS web application for tracking ELO ratings across sports leagues. Users can create or join leagues, record game results, and track both a **global ELO rating** (cross-league, like Chess.com) and a **per-league ELO rating** (isolated to each league).

**There is no backend to deploy.** All business logic runs client-side. Firestore Security Rules are the access control layer.

## Architecture decisions

### No backend

ELO calculation is pure maths and runs entirely in `src/lib/elo.ts`. All Firestore writes happen directly from the client via the Firebase SDK. Security Rules enforce data integrity server-side.

### Dual ELO system

Every player has two ratings:

- **`globalElo`** — stored on `users/{uid}`, updated on every game regardless of league. Starting value: 1000. K-factor: 20.
- **`leagueElo`** — stored on `memberships/{id}`, scoped to a single league. Starting value: 1000. K-factor: 32.

Both are calculated and written atomically in a single Firestore `writeBatch` when a game is recorded.

### Memberships as join collection

The many-to-many between users and leagues is resolved via a `memberships` collection. This is where per-league ELO, wins, and losses live. Do not store league-specific stats on the `users` document.

### Game records are (mostly) immutable audit logs

Once written, game documents are not edited by users. They store per-player ELO snapshots (before/after, both global and league) so rating history can be graphed without recomputation. Two narrow exceptions: (1) a single post-create patch sets `photoUrl` after the optional photo upload completes, (2) `deleteGame` recomputes the `playerElo` map on every subsequent game in the league to keep standings consistent.

### 1v1 and team games share one schema

A game can be `gameType: '1v1'` or `gameType: 'team'`. Both persist as `winnerIds[]` / `loserIds[]` arrays plus a `playerElo` map keyed by uid. A 1v1 is just a team game with single-member sides; the `gameType` field preserves user intent for display. Team ELO uses `calculateTeamElo` in `src/lib/elo.ts` — team rating = mean of members, standard ELO on the two means, same delta applied to every member of each team.

### Invite codes

Leagues have an `inviteCode` field. Users join by querying `leagues where inviteCode == X` client-side, then creating a membership document. No backend required.

---

## Firestore data model

### `users/{uid}`

```
displayName: string
photoURL: string
email: string
globalElo: number          // default 1000
globalWins: number         // default 0
globalLosses: number       // default 0
createdAt: Timestamp
```

### `leagues/{leagueId}`

```
name: string
sport: string
ownerId: string            // uid of creator
inviteCode: string         // short random code for joining
createdAt: Timestamp
```

### `memberships/{membershipId}`

```
userId: string
leagueId: string
leagueElo: number          // default 1000
leagueWins: number         // default 0
leagueLosses: number       // default 0
joinedAt: Timestamp
```

### `games/{gameId}` (unified schema)

```
leagueId: string
gameType: '1v1' | 'team'
winnerIds: string[]          // length 1 for 1v1, N for team
loserIds: string[]
playerElo: {
  [uid]: {
    globalBefore: number
    globalAfter: number
    leagueBefore: number
    leagueAfter: number
  }
}
kFactorGlobal: number
kFactorLeague: number
photoUrl?: string            // Firebase Storage download URL, patched on post-create
playedAt: Timestamp
// Denormalised for the public share card:
leagueName?: string
sport?: string
displayNames?: { [uid]: string }
```

**Legacy docs** (scalar `winnerId`/`loserId` + flat ELO fields) still exist in
Firestore. They are converted to the unified shape on read via `normalizeGame`
in `src/lib/gameSchema.ts`. `useGames`, `getGame`, `getGamesByLeague`, the home
`useRecentUserGame` hook, and `EloHistoryChart` all route reads through it, so
consumer code only ever sees the unified shape. Writes always use the unified
shape — nothing in this codebase should ever persist a legacy doc again.

## ELO calculation

Two pure functions in `src/lib/elo.ts`:

```ts
export function calculateElo(winnerRating, loserRating, k) { /* standard */ }

export function calculateTeamElo(
  winnerRatings: number[],
  loserRatings: number[],
  k: number,
): { winnerDelta: number; loserDelta: number }
```

`calculateTeamElo` averages each side's ratings, runs standard ELO on the two
means, and returns a single delta per side; the recording code applies
`winnerDelta` to every winning-team member and `loserDelta` to every losing-team
member. A 1v1 game is the degenerate case with single-element arrays.

K-factors:

- `K_GLOBAL = 20` — conservative, prestigious global rating
- `K_LEAGUE = 32` — more volatile, reflects league form

When recording a game, call `calculateTeamElo` twice (once per rating type),
build the `playerElo` map for every participant, then commit all writes in a
single Firestore transaction.

---

## Coding conventions

- **TypeScript strictly** — no `any`, no `// @ts-ignore`
- **Named exports** — no default exports except route-level page components
- **Zod schemas** — validate all data before writing to Firestore
- **TanStack Query for all async state** — no `useState` + `useEffect` for data fetching
- **Firestore listeners via TanStack Query** — use `queryClient.setQueryData` inside `onSnapshot` callbacks
- **shadcn/ui for all UI primitives** — do not install other component libraries
- **date-fns for all date formatting** — no `new Date().toLocaleDateString()`
- **Firestore batch writes** — any operation that touches more than one document must use `writeBatch`
- **Security Rules are the backend** — never trust client-side checks alone for access control

---

## Environment variables

All Firebase config lives in `.env.local` (never committed):

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

Access via `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_*`.

## Firestore Security Rules principles

- Users can only read/write their own `users` document
- Any authenticated user can read leagues and memberships (for discovery)
- Only the league owner (`ownerId`) can delete a league
- Membership writes require a valid `userId` matching the authenticated user
- Game writes require every participant (winner + loser ids) to be a member of the referenced league; the writer must be one of the participants
- ELO fields on `users` and `memberships` may only be written as part of a game record (enforce via rules logic)
- Game `photoUrl` may be patched post-create by a participant; no other field may change
- `playerElo` may be rewritten by a participant or league admin/owner only during `deleteGame` recomputes

## Game photos (inline WebP)

Game photos are stored inline as a WebP `data:` URL in the game doc's
`photoUrl` field — **not** Firebase Storage. The client resizes (longest edge
≤ 1280 px) and re-encodes via `<canvas>.toDataURL('image/webp', q)` in
`src/lib/image.ts`, stepping down through quality tiers until the encoded
string fits inside the `MAX_PHOTO_BYTES` budget (~700 KB) that leaves room
for the rest of the Firestore doc (1 MiB cap).

Flow: `recordGame` writes the game doc first (getting a `gameId`); if the
user attached a photo, the form encodes it to WebP and then `setGamePhoto`
patches `photoUrl` onto the doc. `<img src={photoUrl}>` renders data URLs
natively, so consumer components don't care where the bytes came from.

---

## Out of scope (do not implement)

- No backend / Cloud Functions / API routes
- No email/password auth — social login only
- No avatars beyond Firebase Auth photoURL (game photos are an intentional exception, stored inline on the game doc — see Game photos section)
- No payments or subscriptions
- No push notifications
- No admin panel
